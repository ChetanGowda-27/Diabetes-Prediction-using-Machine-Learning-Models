# **Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning**

### **üìä Overview**
Diabetes is a growing global health concern, and early detection can be crucial in reducing its long-term effects. This project explores machine learning models to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various medical attributes. By using algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, we aim to provide an early warning system to assist in medical decision-making.

### **üìà Results**

The following table summarizes the performance of each model:

| Model           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **KNN**         | 0.74     | 0.75      | 0.73   | 0.74     |
| **Random Forest** | 0.78  | 0.79      | 0.77   | 0.78     |
| **SVM**         | 0.75     | 0.75      | 0.75   | 0.75     |

- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest outperforms KNN and SVM in accuracy and F1-score.
- **Key Insights**: All models demonstrated promising results, with Random Forest being the most accurate and balanced in terms of other metrics.
